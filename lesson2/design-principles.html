            <p class="website-name">Amazon</p>
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com" class="website-name">amazon.com</a>

            <p>
                I decided that the color pallette of amazon is a good example of complementary colors on the color wheel with the dark navy and 
                the various shades of yellow/orange. It is not monochromatic or bland but pops in a way that is appealing and simple. It has also
                become a memorable color scheme that is associated with Amazon and its branding.

            <p>
                For Visual Balance I want to point your attention to the centralized font and the logo on the navigation bar that is centralized
                and bolder. The symmetry on both sides adds a nice effect and even the image they are using to advertise their sale is visually
                balanced with the red in the middle and the black on the sides.

                <h3>Repition</h3>
            </div>
            <p class="website-name">Hoka</p>
            <a href="https://www.hoka.com" class="website-name">hoka.com</a>
            <div>
                <img src="./images/hoka.jpg" alt="hoka homepage">
            </div>
            <p>
                For Repition I knew that most sites would have a drop down navigation menu for their site and chose Hoka to fit the theme of athlestic 
                clothes and online shopping. The buttons on the menu are all equally sized and are very similar. This was one of the few repetition options 
                that I could find that would fit on a phone screen to demonstrate the repetitive and clean effect.
